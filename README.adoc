== Need for Async

We want to do more with less.

Resources are expensive: You pay for memory/compute/network usage

----
cost    | $$$                | $$      | $
--------|-------------------------------------------
method  | Multiple Processes | threads | event loop
example | apache             | servlet | netty
----------------------------------------------------

2000 peak rps for 30 servers sounds expensive...

Meanwhile at Apple...

That's pretty big scale... Still expensive xD

Takeaways::
* Need async to reduce footprint, especially important with each service that gets deployed
* Async is difficult, not everyone knows Netty
* Need to find balance between scale and usability

Some arguments::
"Bottle neck is db calls"

This depends on the nature of your application.
Not every app is a CRUD app, and even those that are serve of static/in memory content


== State of async in Java land

Threads/Executors/Mutexes/AtomicReferences

We have the means, but...

* Testing
* Readability, ease of understanding
* Resource sharing (memory, system resources)

== Async is hard

* Non-deterministic
* Callback hell
* Error handling/propagation

How many times have you forgotten to send a response to the user after making some async call in nodejs or Playframework?
Susceptible to brain damage trying to track down what is happening.

== Libraries to the rescue

It's no secret that concurrency is hard.
Different concurrency models have found their way into the JVM ecosystem over the years:

* Futures (callbacks)
* Queues
* Fork/Join
* Actors
* Disruptor
* Continuations (Quasar/parallel universe)

Last few models try to limit or eliminate resource sharing between running threads.

== Ratpack

Ratpack is async and non-blocking (Netty Rocks!)

It provides its own concurrency model (execution model) for managing and handling web requests

== Ratpack Thread Model

Netty's event loop used for compute bound code:

* Entry point to executing your Chain
* Handling NIO events (e.g. read/write)
* Scheduling/Coordinating executions

WARNING: Never block the compute thread!
Don't make any syscalls that block CPU until operation completes!

Thread pool for running blocking code

* For long running computations or code that blocks CPU until further notice

== Ratpack Execution

An execution is a collection of units of work to be executed and managed by Ratpack

These units of work are called execution segment

Any http handling code is always done within an execution

Users schedule execution segments via Promise/Operation/Blocking facilities

Execution segments for a given execution are always executed on the same thread

http://ldaley.com/post/102495950257/ratpacks-execution-model-in-practice

== Ratpack Async Primitives

* Promise
* Operation
* Blocking

All Ratpack primitives are implemented with the Execution api

If you can't find a method in Promise/Operation/Blocking you can always build it yourself!

== Promises/Operations

* Creating Promises schedules execution segments
* Promises are executed in the order they were created (except for forked promises)
* They run on cpu or blocking threads, determined at time of creation.
* Easy to adapt with other async libraries (rx-mongo, thread pools)

== Testability

Ratpack provides ExecHarness test fixture for easy testability

It allows you to run executions without starting a Ratpack server

== ExecHarness

* java.lang.AutoCloseable
* Convenience methods that let ExecHarness manage start/close

Can use Java 7 try-with-resources using new Parrot project (Bridging the gap between Groovy and Java syntax)

== ExecHarness#yield

Great for unit testing, executes a given promise and returns the value from the Promise in a blocking fashion

Automatically subscribes to the Promise, no need to call Promise#then

Comes in two varieties:

ExecHarness#yield::
  Keeps the ExecHarness running

[source, groovy]
----
include::{test}/ExecHarnessSpec.groovy[tags=execHarnessYield,indent=0]
----
<1> Get an instance of ExecHarness
<2> Invoke yield on the instance
<3> Return a Ratpack Promise from the Closure
<4> Extract the value from the Promise
<5> Remember to clean up after ourselves!

ExecHarness.yieldSingle::
  Creates and cleans up ExecHarness on each invocation

[source, groovy]
----
include::{test}/ExecHarnessSpec.groovy[tags=execHarnessYieldSingle, indent=0]
----
<1> Invoke static method ExecHarness.yieldSingle
<2> Return Ratpack Promise from Closure to ExecHarness
<3> Extract value from Promise

== ExecHarness#run

Great for seeing Promises in action, closer to coding experience in Ratpack code

No return value

Promises are not automatically subscribed

Comes in two varieties:

ExecHarness#run::
  Starts and blocks execution until completed

[source, groovy]
----
include::{test}/ExecHarnessSpec.groovy[tags=execHarnessRun, indent=0]
----
<1> Get an instance of ExecHarness
<2> Pass a closure to ExecHarness#run method
<3> Create Ratpack Promise
<4> Subscribe to the Promise
<5> Use Groovy Power Assert to make assertion on value from Promise

ExecHarness.runSingle::
  Creates and cleans up ExecHarness on each invocation

[source, groovy]
----
include::{test}/ExecHarnessSpec.groovy[tags=execHarnessRunSingle, indent=0]
----
<1> Invoke static method ExecHarness.runSingle()
<2> Create Ratpack Promise
<3> Subscribe to Ratpack Promise
<4> Use Groovy Power assert to assert the value resolved from the Promise

NOTE: When making assertions from within closures you need to make sure that you use Groovy Power Assert. Spock does not apply assertions to values from within the Closure

== Advanced Async

* Promised
* SerialBatch/ParallelBatch

== Examples

.Creating promise

.Promise.sync
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=create-sync,indent=0]
----

Promises don't execute when you create them.

.Promise#then
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=unmanaged,indent=0]
----

Promises execute with you subscribe via Promise#then

.Promise.sync yield
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=yieldSync,indent=0]
----

Promises need to execute in Ratpack managed thread.

ExecHarness provides Ratpack managed threads as do RatpackServers of all varieties.

.Promise.sync run
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=runSync,indent=0]
----

.Promise.value
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=promise-value,indent=0]
----
<1> Promise.value creates promise from an already available value, unlike Promise.sync which will wait until the promise is subscribed in order to generate the value.

.Blocking.get()
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=blocking-get,indent=0]
----

.Blocking runs on different threadpool
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=blocking-thread-name,indent=0]
----

.Promise.async
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=third-party-async,indent=0]

include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=promise-async,indent=0]
----

You can think of Operations as a `Promise<Void>`, they don't share a common type but there are ways to switch back and forth betwteen Promises and Operations

.Operation.of
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=operation,indent=0]
----
<1> Factory to queue up an Operation
<2> Note that Operations don't return anything so there is nothing to receive in the subscriber

.Operation to Promise
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=operation-to-promise,indent=0]
----
<1> Invoke Operation#promise to create a Promise<Void>
<2> See that we get null
<3> Note that we can still work with this transformed Promise

.Promise to Operation
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=promise-to-operation,indent=0]
----
<1> We can turn a Promise into an Operation, however note that we still get the previous Promise value
<2> See that Operation doesn't return anything

.Handling errors

Exceptions can be thrown from Promises

.Exception thrown from Promise
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=exception,indent=0]
----

But we can handle it and short circuit

.Promise#onError
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=promise-onerror,indent=0]
----

Or we can handle and continue processing

.Promise#mapError
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=promise-maperror,indent=0]
----

NOTE: Promises are immutable, methods like `Promise#map` always return new promises

.Promises are immutable
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=immutable,indent=0]
----
<1> Promise#onError returns a _new_ Promise
<2> Promise#map returns a _new_ Promise

.Promise api allows you to chain promise manipulation
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=mapPromise,indent=0]
----
<1> Promise#onError returns a new Promise

Error mapping also available in flatmap flavor Promise#flatmapError.

.Transforming Promises

.Promise#map
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=promise-map,indent=0]
----
<1> Promise#map runs on compute thread, don't block here

.Promise#flatMap
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=promise-flatmap,indent=0]
----
<1> Promise#flatMap runs on compute thread, don't block here
<2> Since Blocking#get returns a Promise, need to use Promise#flatMap in order to "unpack" the nested promise and continue working with the value as in <3>

.Promise#blockingMap
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=promise-blockingmap,indent=0]
----
<1> A convenience method for executing blocking code inline without having to do `Promise#flatMap { Blocking.get {} }` as in the previous example

.Promise#flatMap with async
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=promise-flatmap-async,indent=0]
----
<1> Integrating with an externally managed threadpool/async library

.Composing promises

.Promise#left/right
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=promise-composition-pair,indent=0]
----
<1> Imagine some blocking jdbc lookup by name
<2> Promise#right takes the result of the previous promise and creates a tuple like graph datastructure called Pair. The value returned from the closure/lambda is then pushed to the "right" position of the Pair
<3> Imagine some in memory lookup for interests by user that we just looked up from <1>
<4> The result from the previous call is of type `Pair<A, B>` where `A` is the result of the `Blocking.get{}` call and `B` is ther result of `Promise#right` call

Pairs are handy when working with small number of arguments.

You can also nest Pairs, you can have something like `Pair<Pair<A, B>, C>` but this quickly becomes hard to track.

If only Java had tuple support :(

This is also available in flatMap flavor Promise#flatLeft/flatRight

* ParallelBatch, SerialBatch
You'll often want to take a list of promises and transform them into a list of resolved values. ParallelBatch and SerialBatch help achieve this.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=batch-basic,indent=0]
----
<1> Simulate price lookup in a blocking manner
<2> Use a Groovy range to generate a list of promises to lookup the price for the given id
<3> Invoke either `SerialBatch.of` or `ParallelBatch.of` and yield a `Promise<List<Map<String, Object>>>`
<4> Use the handy value as a single list
<5> Spock datatable for making `batch` pluggable

Batch is great for when you have `List<Promise<A>>` but want to work with `Promise<List<A>>` in subsequent calculations.

Forking execution

.Promise#fork
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=fork,indent=0]
----
<1> Convenience closure for printing and adding to list
<2> Add foo in a blocking manner
<3> Add bar in async manner
<4> Fork the bar async promise
<5> Assert that bar was entered before foo

NOTE: When forking Promises, they execute immediately!

"Flow control"

.Promise#mapIf
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=map-if,indent=0]
----
<1> Convenience closure
<2> Example of using `Promise#mapIf(Predicate, Function)`, only maps if predicate passes
<3> Execute these promises in parallel
<4> Assert that our list is fizzbuzzed correctly

Also available in flatMap variety Promise#flatMapIf

Other useful methods:

* Promise#onNull
* Promise#route

WARNING: Promise#route is a terminating call, the rest of the promise chain is no longer executed!!

.Promise#route(Predicate, Action)
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=route,indent=0]
----
<1> Note that we terminate the promise chain here if predicate passes

.Throttling Promises
Throttle acts as a semaphore only allowing n number of promises to run in parallel.

.Promise#throttled
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=throttle,indent=0]
----
<1> Declare a throttle of size 3
<2> Make sure that the promise we submit to the ParallelBatch is throttled

.Sample output

2017-05-30T07:42:56.377 EXECUTING FIZZBUZZ for 14
----

You can see there is a tight grouping of 3 per time period

.Spying

If you wish to observe items as they get processed in the promise chain, you can make use of Promise#wiretap

.Promise#wiretap
[source,groovy]
----
include::{test}/PromiseSpec.groovy[tags=wiretap,indent=0]
----
<1> Invoke wiretap method
<2> Note that we have to invoke Result#getValue in order to get the value produced from the previous Promise
<3> Note that the next processor gets the same result as the wiretap


== Best practices

* Avoid multiple then blocks
* Try to linearize/flatten data flow
